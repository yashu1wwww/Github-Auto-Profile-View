Change the URL you require on the 14th line and update the number of profile views on the 24th line.

Download Turbo VPN for Windows from https://turbovpn.com/download/windows and connect it when you run the bot to hide your location.

After downloading the chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), extract it to the downloaded folder that matches your Chrome version on your PC.

Then, enter "git.py" in the command prompt or double-click on the "git.py" file.

After seeing this script, don't assume that my profile views are automatically increased.

👉If you have the latest version of Selenium, the code may not run

👉open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter

pip install selenium==4.2.1 or pip install selenium==4.2.0
